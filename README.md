# Rule-Based Expert System: Farming Guide for Swine Raising with Swine Disease Identifier Using Forward Chaining Method
Rule-based expert systems (RBES) are Artificial Intelligence systems that emulate expert human reasoning processes over a set of rules and knowledge from a specific domain. Rule Base Algorithm is designed to have an artificial intelligence strategy or machine learning that distinguishes, learns, or advances 'rules' to store, control, or apply. The forward Chaining method is a procedure for searching or tracking techniques ahead which starts with the current information and combines rules to produce a conclusion or goal. 

This is a android-based capstone project which is converted from the web application using a mobile application framework known as Cordova. The Rule-Based Algorithm Forward Chaining Method was coded manually without the use of Rule-based expert system builder software hence the data is limited.

It is focused on the utilization the Rule Based Algorithm Foward Chaining Method to identify common swine disease that the farmer may encountered during the process of raising swine. It gives a results about the identified swine disease and displays its treatment and methods of prevention. It also has an informative manual about raising a swine from birth to commercialization and the basic symptoms of common swine diseases. 

This capstone project has awarded as a "Best Information Technology Innovation" during 3rd Information Technology Innovation Forum held at the College of Computer Studies Misamis University.

To set up the system:
1. Download the APK file to your android phone.
2. Install the APK file.
3. See the "Documentation.docx" and the "User Manual.docx" for additional information.
